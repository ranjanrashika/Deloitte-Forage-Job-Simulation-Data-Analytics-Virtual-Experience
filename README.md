# Deloitte-Forage-Job-Simulation-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience
## This repository contains my completed work for the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program hosted on Forage. The program simulates real-world tasks carried out by Deloitte analysts, providing insights into how data is used to inform strategic business decisions.
## 📌 Program Overview
This simulation involved both scenario-based consulting questions and hands-on data analysis tasks. I was required to evaluate business challenges, recommend solutions without prior data, and later validate those decisions using structured datasets. The goal was to develop analytical and consulting skills in a realistic, client-facing environment.
